Hi! I am Varun Madathil, a postdoctoral associate at Yale University, hosted by [Dr. Charalampos (Babis) Papamanthou](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/cpap/). 

I was incredibly fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Alessandra Scafuro](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/ascafuro/) during my time as a Ph.D. student in the [Wolfpack Privacy and Research Lab](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University. During my Ph.D. I had the opportunity to visit [Dr. Foteini Baldimtsi](https://www.baldimtsi.com) at George Mason University in 2018, [Dr. Markulf Kohlweiss](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mkohlwei/) at University of Edinburgh in 2019, [Dr. Pedro-Moreno Sanchez](https://software.imdea.org/~pedro.moreno/) in 2021 and more recently [Dr. Aniket Kate](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/akate/) in 2024 at Purdue University. 


Prior to my Ph.D. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2016.

I am interested in cryptography. More specifically, I am interested in anonymity and privacy-preserving multiparty protocols and their applications to real-world systems like blockchains. Find my latest resume [here](/files/resume.pdf)
